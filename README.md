# bulk-barcode-gen
Bulk generator of Code-39 barcodes.

Developed in Processing/Java by Erin Burba at Sikubora Ltd, Arusha, Tanzania.

Produce a bulk set of Code-39 barcode images. Enter the starting value and the number of barcodes to be generated, and the barcode images will appear in the directory of the executable file.

To run program: download lib and source directories along with barcodeGenJava.exe in the same directory. 

Suggested/planned improvements:
- Adjust output image width to accommodate different sizes of barcodes.
- Specify the target directory for the output.
- Specify image file type (jpeg, png, etc).
- More encoding options.

Feel free to contribute, comment, and report issues!
